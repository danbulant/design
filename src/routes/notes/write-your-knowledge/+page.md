You won't remember everything. Use micro notes if lazy. Publish them should you wish to share (you should!), don't if you do not. But write your knowledge.

This is my collection of notes, mainly for tech purposes, like solving programming issues, CTF write-ups and more. Majority of them won't bring anything new to the world, though they were once new to me, and I don't wish to have to research them all again, I want to research new ideas instead.

Perhaps I'll rewrite some of those notes into full fledged posts. For now, these remain just short, dense notes. This is a call to make your own hacktricks.
